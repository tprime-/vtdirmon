Python script which monitors a directory for added files, uploads them to VirusTotal, and returns the results

Usage: ./vtdirmon.py <directory>

This script can be used for a PirateBox or anywhere users upload or share untrusted files. The output of the script can be returned to users to display a hash, VirusTotal URL, and whether the file is clean or infected.
